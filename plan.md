# Energy Auction Contract Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan addresses all incomplete implementations in the energy auction contract to make it production-ready with robust multi-seller support, proper error handling, and comprehensive governance mechanisms.

## AI Builder Rules
1. **No Commented TODOs**: All implementations must be complete with no placeholder comments
2. **Complete Error Handling**: Every function must handle all edge cases with proper error messages
3. **Mathematical Safety**: All arithmetic operations must use checked math with overflow protection
4. **Memory Efficiency**: Optimize account iterations and implement pagination where needed
5. **Security First**: Implement proper authorization checks and prevent reentrancy attacks
6. **Gas Optimization**: Minimize compute units while maintaining functionality
7. **Test Coverage**: Each implementation must include comprehensive test scenarios
8. **Documentation**: All new functions must have clear documentation with examples

## Phase 1: Critical Issues (HIGH PRIORITY)

### 1.1 Fix Buyer Escrow Calculation
**Location**: `calculate_buyer_allocations` function (line 1287)

**Current Issue**:
```rust
buyer_allocation.total_escrowed = 0; // This should be set by the caller
```

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Calculate total escrowed amount by iterating through all buyer's bids
- Sum up `price * quantity` for all active bids from this buyer
- Add validation to ensure escrow amount matches actual token transfers
- Include overflow protection for large calculations

**New Function**: `calculate_buyer_escrow_amount`
```rust
pub fn calculate_buyer_escrow_amount(
    ctx: Context<CalculateBuyerEscrow>,
    buyer_key: Pubkey,
) -> Result<u64>
```

### 1.2 Complete Seller Allocation Creation
**Location**: `process_supply_batch` function (lines 294-303)

**Current Issue**: Only emits events instead of creating seller allocation accounts

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Remove event emission approach
- Implement direct account creation within the instruction
- Add proper space calculation and rent exemption
- Include batch size limits to prevent compute exhaustion
- Add rollback mechanism if any allocation fails

**Modified Function**: Update `process_supply_batch` to handle account creation directly

## Phase 2: Missing Core Features (HIGH PRIORITY)

**New Instructions**:
```rust
pub fn refund_cancelled_auction_buyers(ctx: Context<RefundCancelledBuyers>) -> Result<()>
pub fn refund_cancelled_auction_sellers(ctx: Context<RefundCancelledSellers>) -> Result<()>
pub fn process_cancellation_batch(ctx: Context<ProcessCancellationBatch>, batch_size: u32) -> Result<()>
```

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Iterate through all bid pages and return escrowed quote tokens to buyers
- Return escrowed energy tokens to sellers
- Calculate and distribute any accrued interest/fees
- Implement batch processing to handle large numbers of participants
- Add comprehensive logging for audit trails

### 2.2 Slashing Mechanism for Non-Delivery
**New Instructions**:
```rust
pub fn report_non_delivery(ctx: Context<ReportNonDelivery>, evidence_hash: [u8; 32]) -> Result<()>
pub fn execute_slashing(ctx: Context<ExecuteSlashing>, slashing_amount: u64) -> Result<()>
pub fn appeal_slashing(ctx: Context<AppealSlashing>, appeal_data: Vec<u8>) -> Result<()>
```

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Add delivery verification system with oracle integration
- Implement graduated slashing penalties (warning → partial → full)
- Create appeal process with time-bound resolution
- Add slashing insurance pool funded by seller deposits
- Include reputation scoring system

### 2.3 Comprehensive Error Recovery
**New Instructions**:
```rust

pub fn recover_stuck_funds(ctx: Context<RecoverStuckFunds>, recovery_type: RecoveryType) -> Result<()>
pub fn emergency_pause(ctx: Context<EmergencyPause>) -> Result<()>
pub fn emergency_resume(ctx: Context<EmergencyResume>) -> Result<()>
```

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Add circuit breaker pattern for critical failures
- Implement state rollback for partial auction failures
- Create fund recovery mechanisms with multi-sig approval
- Add emergency pause functionality with time limits
- Include automatic recovery triggers based on predefined conditions

## Phase 3: Governance and Upgrades (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

### 3.1 Protocol Governance System
**New Instructions**:
```rust
pub fn propose_parameter_change(ctx: Context<ProposeChange>, proposal: ParameterProposal) -> Result<()>
pub fn vote_on_proposal(ctx: Context<VoteProposal>, proposal_id: u64, vote: Vote) -> Result<()>
pub fn execute_proposal(ctx: Context<ExecuteProposal>, proposal_id: u64) -> Result<()>
pub fn update_protocol_parameters(ctx: Context<UpdateParameters>, new_params: ProtocolParams) -> Result<()>
```

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Add time-locked parameter changes with voting mechanism
- Implement multi-sig authority with configurable thresholds
- Create proposal system for fee changes, limits, and new features
- Add emergency governance override with strict conditions
- Include parameter validation and rollback capabilities

### 3.2 Upgrade Infrastructure
**New Instructions**:
```rust
pub fn prepare_upgrade(ctx: Context<PrepareUpgrade>, new_version: u8) -> Result<()>
pub fn execute_upgrade(ctx: Context<ExecuteUpgrade>) -> Result<()>
pub fn rollback_upgrade(ctx: Context<RollbackUpgrade>) -> Result<()>
```

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Add version compatibility checks
- Implement data migration strategies
- Create upgrade testing framework
- Add automatic rollback on upgrade failures
- Include upgrade announcement and grace periods

## Phase 4: Technical Debt Resolution (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

### 4.1 Computation Efficiency Optimization
**Optimizations Required**:
- Replace multiple `remaining_accounts` iterations with single pass
- Implement account indexing for O(1) lookups
- Add pagination for large seller/buyer sets
- Optimize memory usage in batch processing
- Implement lazy loading for large data structures

**New Data Structures**:
```rust
pub struct AccountIndex {
    pub account_type: AccountType,
    pub key_to_position: BTreeMap<Pubkey, usize>,
}

pub struct PaginatedProcessor {
    pub current_page: u32,
    pub page_size: u32,
    pub total_items: u32,
    pub processing_state: ProcessingState,
}
```

### 4.2 Dynamic Scaling System
**New Instructions**:
```rust
pub fn adjust_limits(ctx: Context<AdjustLimits>, new_limits: SystemLimits) -> Result<()>
pub fn scale_capacity(ctx: Context<ScaleCapacity>, scale_factor: u16) -> Result<()>
```

- Add dynamic limit adjustment based on network conditions
- Implement auto-scaling based on usage patterns
- Add capacity monitoring and alerting
- Include performance benchmarking tools

## Phase 5: Advanced Features (LOW PRIORITY)
